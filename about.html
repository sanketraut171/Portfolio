               <b>About Me</b>
        <p>  
        Hello there! I'm Sanket M. Raut, a passionate and dedicated Computer 
        Science enthusiast with a relentless drive for knowledge and innovation. 
        I firmly believe in the transformative power of technology to shape our 
        world for the better. As I embark on my journey in this dynamic field, 
        I'm excited to share a bit about what makes me tick. 
        
        </p>
                  <b> Education</b> 
         <p>
        I recently earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and 
        Engineering from KDK College of Engineering, Nagpur. With a CGPA of 7.27, 
        I've developed a strong foundation in a range of computer science 
        disciplines. 
    </p>
        
       <b> Technical Skills: </b> 
       <p>
        I thrive in the digital realm, with proficiency in .NET, Java Full Stack
        Development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. From designing sleek, 
        user-friendly web interfaces to diving deep into database management, 
        I relish every facet of the digital landscape. 
    
    </p>
       <b> Certifications </b>
       <p>
        A highlight in my learning journey is completing the Java programming 
        course through NPTEL, where I achieved an elite silver certificate. 
    </p>
        <b>Research and Innovation </b> 
    
        <p>
        I'm not just content with theory; I like to apply my knowledge in practical 
        ways. One of my most exciting projects involved improving ATM security using 
        facial recognition, a topic I also presented at the Spark Conference. 
        In my final year, I developed an Airline Reservation System Desktop 
        Application using Java and SQL. 
        </p>
          <b>Interpersonal skills</b>
       <p>
        I'm a perpetual learner, always eager to explore new horizons in technology. 
        My dedication, persistence, and quick learning abilities have been the 
        driving force behind my academic and professional success. I believe that 
        effective communication is paramount in today's collaborative world, 
        and I'm fluent in Marathi, Hindi, and English.
